    <h3>What To Do</h3>
    <p>Grilling the perfect salmon is probably easier than you think.<br> You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:<br>
    Season and marinate the salmon for at least two hours in the refrigerator.<br> Preheat a grill and lightly oil the grate. Place the salmon on the grill and discard the marinade. <br>Cook on each side until the fish flakes easily with a fork.</p>

    </ul>
    <ol><strong>Step 1</strong>
